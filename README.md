# Readings-AI

As the opposite of [Papers-System](https://github.com/ScottLinnn/Papers-System), this repo compiles reading materials for AI.  
It's intentional that it's named "Readings-AI" but not "Papers-AI", because this is a quickly evolving field such that limiting to papers is not a good choice.
